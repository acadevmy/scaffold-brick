## Devmy code generators

Use Devmy cli to leverage their code generators.

```
# Add application
devmy generate angular

# Run applications in development env
pnpm run start
```

Run `devmy --help` to get a list of available commands.

Learn more about [devmy cli](https://gitlab.com/pillar-1/devmy-cli/-/wikis/Docs) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute a single task with pnpm use the following syntax:

```
pnpm --filter <package_name> <command>
```

You can also run multiple applications using root package:

```
pnpm run <command>
```

Devmy uses a standardized set of commands. make sure you implement them all correctly and don't invent new ones if already included in the standard ones.
